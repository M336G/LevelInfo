# Level Info

A QoL mod that displays stats about levels

Pretty much every stats are toggleable

### Why did you make this?

I was bored, so I made this for fun. I also wanted to learn a bit about C++, since I had never tried this language before (which also means the code might be extremely unoptimized, so feel free to make pull requests, it would really help!).

### Special Thanks

Thanks to dankmeme for helping me figuring out some mistakes I made in my code.
