# Level Info
A <cb>simple</c> and <cb>customizable</c> mod that displays information about the level you are on such as the <cl>requested difficulty</c> by its creator, its <cl>featured rank</c>, its <cl>object count</c>, the <cl>version in which the level was created</c>, how many <cl>updates the level received</c>, what was the <cl>original ID</c> of the copied level, if the level is using <cl>two player mode</c>, how much <cl>time the creator(s) of the level spent in the editor</c> (and also with copies), how many <cl>attempts</c> you have on the level, how many <cl>times you jumped</c> and <cl>clicked</c> in the level and what was your <cl>best run</c>.

Pretty much everything can be <cg>enabled</c>/<cr>disabled</c>, even the <co>text color</c> can be <cb>customized</c>!
